**Abstract**: The development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) brings numerous potential benefits to the transportation system. However, during their widespread adoption, there will inevitably be a transitional phase where CAVs coexist with Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) for an extended period, presenting challenges to both traffic flow stability and the realization of CAV’s full advantages. Dedicated lanes can provide CAVs with exclusive road rights, thereby helping to restore traffic order. In light of this, this paper proposes an improved Cell Transmission Model (CTM) capable of effectively simulating the operational states of multi-lane mixed traffic flows. Through simulation experiments conducted in two different scenarios, this study not only verifies the accuracy and applicability of the model but also provides specific recommendations for the establishment of dedicated lanes.
