**Abstract**: Understanding car-following behavior in the vicinity of signalized intersections is essential for improving the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of urban traffic systems. In this paper, we investigate car-following behavior on signalized roads through car-following experiments on a closed track with signal lights, collecting high precision positioning data for each vehicle. We analyze the driving behavior of individual vehicles passing through signal lights and the car-following evolution of a four-vehicle platoon, as well as traffic energy consumption and emissions. Seven types of single-vehicle driving behaviors are identified and their distribution is analyzed under varying distances to the signal light and speed limits. It is found that drivers commonly adopt the behavior of decelerating and then accelerating to pass signal intersections to avoid stopping. Three types of platoon behaviors are identified and the evolution of platoon length, average speed, and oscillation propagation was analyzed, revealing significant impacts of signals on platoon dynamics.
